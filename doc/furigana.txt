==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*furigana-introduction*

The furigana plugin adds furigana to Japanese texts.

What is furigana?~

Furigana are small characters added to Japanese texts to show the pronounciation
of complicated or uncommon kanji.

What is ruby?~

Ruby is the general term for these kinds of annotations.  This kind of
pronounciation guide is not limited to Japan, but used in all languages that use
Chinese characters (like Chinese, Japanese and Korean).

This plugin is not really limited to Japanese texts, however support for other
languages has not yet been integrated.

Why is this plugin called furigana and not ruby?~

For the simple reason to avoid confusion with the Ruby scripting language.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements					*furigana-requirements*

Your version of Vim has to be compiled with Python support. If |:version| includes
|+python| you are good to go.

This plugin requires mecab to analyse the texts and split them into words.
Additionally kakasi is required for the katakana to hiragana conversion.

==============================================================================
3. Usage					*furigana-usage*

There are several ways to generate furigana.  The main mapping defined by the
plugin is <gr> (mnemonic: generate ruby).  This can be followed by a motion.
For example <graw> can be used to add furigana to a word.
To add furigana to the current line you can use <grr>.
It is also possible to use <gr> in visual mode.

==============================================================================
4. Configuration				*furigana-configuration*

					*'g:furigana_format_string'*
'g:furigana_format_string'		string (default: "\\ruby{%k}{%r}")
					global
	This pattern is used to add furigana to the selected text.  The
	placeholders %k (for kanji) and %r (for reading, i.e., the
	furigana/ruby) can be used.

	The default format string can be used for LaTeX documents that can
	handle the ruby command (i.e., XeLaTeX).

	For HTML ruby tags this format string could be used:
	"<ruby>%k<rp>(</rp><rt>%r</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>"
